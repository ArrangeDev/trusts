  <h3>‚ú® Overview</h2>
  <p>
   Trusts Protocol is an on-chain primitive for yield contributions that allows you to leverage a variety of DeFi protocols to make recurring contributions to multiple different wallets. 
   It uses Lulo Finance as proxy for protocols like MarginFi, Kamino Finance, Solend, Drift Protocol, and Mango Markets; ultimately allowing a depositor to get the best rates possible on their
   capital.
